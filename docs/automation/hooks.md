# Hooks

Hooks provide an extensible event-driven system for automating actions in response to agent commands and events. Hooks are automatically discovered from directories and can be inspected with `openclaw hooks`, while hook-pack installation and updates now go through `openclaw plugins`.

## Getting Oriented

Hooks are small scripts that run when something happens. There are two kinds:

- **Hooks** (this page): run inside the Gateway when agent events fire, like `/new`, `/reset`, `/stop`, or lifecycle events.
- **Webhooks**: external HTTP webhooks that let other systems trigger work in OpenClaw. See [Webhooks](/automation/cron-jobs#webhooks) or use `openclaw webhooks` for Gmail helper commands.

Hooks can also be bundled inside plugins; see [Plugin hooks](/plugins/architecture#provider-runtime-hooks). `openclaw hooks list` shows both standalone hooks and plugin-managed hooks.

Common uses:

- Save a memory snapshot when you reset a session
- Keep an audit trail of commands for troubleshooting or compliance
- Trigger follow-up automation when a session starts or ends
- Write files into the agent workspace or call external APIs when events fire

If you can write a small TypeScript function, you can write a hook. Managed and bundled hooks are trusted local code. Workspace hooks are discovered automatically, but OpenClaw keeps them disabled until you explicitly enable them via the CLI or config.

## Overview

The hooks system allows you to:

- Save session context to memory when `/new` is issued
- Log all commands for auditing
- Trigger custom automations on agent lifecycle events
- Extend OpenClaw's behavior without modifying core code

## Getting Started

### Bundled Hooks

OpenClaw ships with four bundled hooks that are automatically discovered:

- **💾 session-memory**: Saves session context to your agent workspace (default `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/`) when you issue `/new` or `/reset`
- **📎 bootstrap-extra-files**: Injects additional workspace bootstrap files from configured glob/path patterns during `agent:bootstrap`
- **📝 command-logger**: Logs all command events to `~/.openclaw/logs/commands.log`
- **🚀 boot-md**: Runs `BOOT.md` when the gateway starts (requires internal hooks enabled)

List available hooks:

```bash
openclaw hooks list
```

Enable a hook:

```bash
openclaw hooks enable session-memory
```

Check hook status:

```bash
openclaw hooks check
```

Get detailed information:

```bash
openclaw hooks info session-memory
```

### Onboarding

During onboarding (`openclaw onboard`), you'll be prompted to enable recommended hooks. The wizard automatically discovers eligible hooks and presents them for selection.

### Trust Boundary

Hooks run inside the Gateway process. Treat bundled hooks, managed hooks, and `hooks.internal.load.extraDirs` as trusted local code. Workspace hooks under `<workspace>/hooks/` are repo-local code, so OpenClaw requires an explicit enable step before loading them.

## Hook Discovery

Hooks are automatically discovered from these directories, in order of increasing override precedence:

1. **Bundled hooks**: shipped with OpenClaw; located at `<openclaw>/dist/hooks/bundled/` for npm installs (or a sibling `hooks/bundled/` for compiled binaries)
2. **Plugin hooks**: hooks bundled inside installed plugins (see [Plugin hooks](/plugins/architecture#provider-runtime-hooks))
3. **Managed hooks**: `~/.openclaw/hooks/` (user-installed, shared across workspaces; can override bundled and plugin hooks). **Extra hook directories** configured via `hooks.internal.load.extraDirs` are also treated as managed hooks and share the same override precedence.
4. **Workspace hooks**: `<workspace>/hooks/` (per-agent, disabled by default until explicitly enabled; cannot override hooks from other sources)

Workspace hooks can add new hook names for a repo, but they cannot override bundled, managed, or plugin-provided hooks with the same name.

Managed hook directories can be either a **single hook** or a **hook pack** (package directory).

Each hook is a directory containing:

```
my-hook/
├── HOOK.md          # Metadata + documentation
└── handler.ts       # Handler implementation
```

## Hook Packs (npm/archives)

Hook packs are standard npm packages that export one or more hooks via `openclaw.hooks` in
`package.json`. Install them with:

```bash
openclaw plugins install <path-or-spec>
```

Npm specs are registry-only (package name + optional exact version or dist-tag).
Git/URL/file specs and semver ranges are rejected.

Bare specs and `@latest` stay on the stable track. If npm resolves either of
those to a prerelease, OpenClaw stops and asks you to opt in explicitly with a
prerelease tag such as `@beta`/`@rc` or an exact prerelease version.

Example `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/my-hooks",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "openclaw": {
    "hooks": ["./hooks/my-hook", "./hooks/other-hook"]
  }
}
```

Each entry points to a hook directory containing `HOOK.md` and a handler file. The loader tries `handler.ts`, `handler.js`, `index.ts`, `index.js` in order.
Hook packs can ship dependencies; they will be installed under `~/.openclaw/hooks/<id>`.
Each `openclaw.hooks` entry must stay inside the package directory after symlink
resolution; entries that escape are rejected.

Security note: `openclaw plugins install` installs hook-pack dependencies with `npm install --ignore-scripts`
(no lifecycle scripts). Keep hook pack dependency trees "pure JS/TS" and avoid packages that rely
on `postinstall` builds.

## Hook Structure

### HOOK.md Format

The `HOOK.md` file contains metadata in YAML frontmatter plus Markdown documentation:

```markdown
---
name: my-hook
description: "Short description of what this hook does"
homepage: https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/hooks#my-hook
metadata:
  { "openclaw": { "emoji": "🔗", "events": ["command:new"], "requires": { "bins": ["node"] } } }
---

# My Hook

Detailed documentation goes here...

## What It Does

- Listens for `/new` commands
- Performs some action
- Logs the result

## Requirements

- Node.js must be installed

## Configuration

No configuration needed.
```

### Metadata Fields

The `metadata.openclaw` object supports:

- **`emoji`**: Display emoji for CLI (e.g., `"💾"`)
- **`events`**: Array of events to listen for (e.g., `["command:new", "command:reset"]`)
- **`export`**: Named export to use (defaults to `"default"`)
- **`homepage`**: Documentation URL
- **`os`**: Required platforms (e.g., `["darwin", "linux"]`)
- **`requires`**: Optional requirements
  - **`bins`**: Required binaries on PATH (e.g., `["git", "node"]`)
  - **`anyBins`**: At least one of these binaries must be present
  - **`env`**: Required environment variables
  - **`config`**: Required config paths (e.g., `["workspace.dir"]`)
- **`always`**: Bypass eligibility checks (boolean)
- **`install`**: Installation methods (for bundled hooks: `[{"id":"bundled","kind":"bundled"}]`)

### Handler Implementation

The `handler.ts` file exports a `HookHandler` function:

```typescript
const myHandler = async (event) => {
  // Only trigger on 'new' command
  if (event.type !== "command" || event.action !== "new") {
    return;
  }

  console.log(`[my-hook] New command triggered`);
  console.log(`  Session: ${event.sessionKey}`);
  console.log(`  Timestamp: ${event.timestamp.toISOString()}`);

  // Your custom logic here

  // Optionally send message to user
  event.messages.push("✨ My hook executed!");
};

export default myHandler;
```

#### Event Context

Each event includes:

```typescript
{
  type: 'command' | 'session' | 'agent' | 'gateway' | 'message',
  action: string,              // e.g., 'new', 'reset', 'stop', 'received', 'sent'
  sessionKey: string,          // Session identifier
  timestamp: Date,             // When the event occurred
  messages: string[],          // Push messages here to send to user
  context: {
    // Command events (command:new, command:reset):
    sessionEntry?: SessionEntry,       // current session entry
    previousSessionEntry?: SessionEntry, // pre-reset entry (preferred for session-memory)
    commandSource?: string,            // e.g., 'whatsapp', 'telegram'
    senderId?: string,
    workspaceDir?: string,
    cfg?: OpenClawConfig,
    // Command events (command:stop only):
    sessionId?: string,
    // Agent bootstrap events (agent:bootstrap):
    bootstrapFiles?: WorkspaceBootstrapFile[],
    sessionKey?: string,           // routing session key
    sessionId?: string,            // internal session UUID
    agentId?: string,              // resolved agent ID
    // Message events (see Message Events section for full details):
    from?: string,             // message:received
    to?: string,               // message:sent
    content?: string,
    channelId?: string,
    success?: boolean,         // message:sent
  }
}
```

## Event Types

### Command Events

Triggered when agent commands are issued:

- **`command`**: All command events (general listener)
- **`command:new`**: When `/new` command is issued
- **`command:reset`**: When `/reset` command is issued
- **`command:stop`**: When `/stop` command is issued

### Session Events

- **`session:compact:before`**: Right before compaction summarizes history
- **`session:compact:after`**: After compaction completes with summary metadata

Internal hook payloads emit these as `type: "session"` with `action: "compact:before"` / `action: "compact:after"`; listeners subscribe with the combined keys above.
Specific handler registration uses the literal key format `${type}:${action}`. For these events, register `session:compact:before` and `session:compact:after`.

`session:compact:before` context fields:

- `sessionId`: internal session UUID
- `missingSessionKey`: true when no session key was available
- `messageCount`: number of messages before compaction
- `tokenCount`: token count before compaction (may be absent)
- `messageCountOriginal`: message count from the full untruncated session history
- `tokenCountOriginal`: token count of the full original history (may be absent)

`session:compact:after` context fields (in addition to `sessionId` and `missingSessionKey`):

- `messageCount`: message count after compaction
- `tokenCount`: token count after compaction (may be absent)
- `compactedCount`: number of messages that were compacted/removed
- `summaryLength`: character length of the generated compaction summary
- `tokensBefore`: token count from before compaction (for delta calculation)
- `tokensAfter`: token count after compaction
- `firstKeptEntryId`: ID of the first message entry retained after compaction

### Agent Events

- **`agent:bootstrap`**: Before workspace bootstrap files are injected (hooks may mutate `context.bootstrapFiles`)

### Gateway Events

Triggered when the gateway starts:

- **`gateway:startup`**: After channels start and hooks are loaded

### Session Patch Events

Triggered when session properties are modified:

- **`session:patch`**: When a session is updated

#### Session Event Context

Session events include rich context about the session and changes:

```typescript
{
  sessionEntry: SessionEntry, // The complete updated session entry
  patch: {                    // The patch object (only changed fields)
    // Session identity & labeling
    label?: string | null,           // Human-readable session label

    // AI model configuration
    model?: string | null,           // Model override (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-6")
    thinkingLevel?: string | null,   // Thinking level ("off"|"low"|"med"|"high")
    verboseLevel?: string | null,    // Verbose output level
    reasoningLevel?: string | null,  // Reasoning mode override
    elevatedLevel?: string | null,   // Elevated mode override
    responseUsage?: "off" | "tokens" | "full" | "on" | null, // Usage display mode ("on" is backwards-compat alias for "full")
    fastMode?: boolean | null,                    // Fast/turbo mode toggle
    spawnedWorkspaceDir?: string | null,          // Workspace dir override for spawned subagents
    subagentRole?: "orchestrator" | "leaf" | null, // Subagent role assignment
    subagentControlScope?: "children" | "none" | null, // Scope of subagent control

    // Tool execution settings
    execHost?: string | null,        // Exec host (sandbox|gateway|node)
    execSecurity?: string | null,    // Security mode (deny|allowlist|full)
    execAsk?: string | null,         // Approval mode (off|on-miss|always)
    execNode?: string | null,        // Node ID for host=node

    // Subagent coordination
    spawnedBy?: string | null,       // Parent session key (for subagents)
    spawnDepth?: number | null,      // Nesting depth (0 = root)

    // Communication policies
    sendPolicy?: "allow" | "deny" | null,          // Message send policy
    groupActivation?: "mention" | "always" | null, // Group chat activation
  },
  cfg: OpenClawConfig            // Current gateway config
}
```

**Security note:** Only privileged clients (including the Control UI) can trigger `session:patch` events. Standard WebChat clients are blocked from patching sessions, so the hook will not fire from those connections.

See `SessionsPatchParamsSchema` in `src/gateway/protocol/schema/sessions.ts` for the complete type definition.

#### Example: Session Patch Logger Hook

```typescript
const handler = async (event) => {
  if (event.type !== "session" || event.action !== "patch") {
    return;
  }
  const { patch } = event.context;
  console.log(`[session-patch] Session updated: ${event.sessionKey}`);
  console.log(`[session-patch] Changes:`, patch);
};

export default handler;
```

### Message Events

Triggered when messages are received or sent:

- **`message`**: All message events (general listener)
- **`message:received`**: When an inbound message is received from any channel. Fires early in processing before media understanding. Content may contain raw placeholders like `<media:audio>` for media attachments that haven't been processed yet.
- **`message:transcribed`**: When a message has been fully processed, including audio transcription and link understanding. At this point, `transcript` contains the full transcript text for audio messages. Use this hook when you need access to transcribed audio content.
- **`message:preprocessed`**: Fires for every message after all media + link understanding completes, giving hooks access to the fully enriched body (transcripts, image descriptions, link summaries) before the agent sees it.
- **`message:sent`**: When an outbound message is successfully sent

#### Message Event Context

Message events include rich context about the message:

```typescript
// message:received context
{
  from: string,           // Sender identifier (phone number, user ID, etc.)
  content: string,        // Message content
  timestamp?: number,     // Unix timestamp when received
  channelId: string,      // Channel (e.g., "whatsapp", "telegram", "discord")
  accountId?: string,     // Provider account ID for multi-account setups
  conversationId?: string, // Chat/conversation ID
  messageId?: string,     // Message ID from the provider
  metadata?: {            // Additional provider-specific data
    to?: string,
    provider?: string,
    surface?: string,
    threadId?: string | number,
    senderId?: string,
    senderName?: string,
    senderUsername?: string,
    senderE164?: string,
    guildId?: string,     // Discord guild / server ID
    channelName?: string, // Channel name (e.g., Discord channel name)
  }
}

// message:sent context
{
  to: string,             // Recipient identifier
  content: string,        // Message content that was sent
  success: boolean,       // Whether the send succeeded
  error?: string,         // Error message if sending failed
  channelId: string,      // Channel (e.g., "whatsapp", "telegram", "discord")
  accountId?: string,     // Provider account ID
  conversationId?: string, // Chat/conversation ID
  messageId?: string,     // Message ID returned by the provider
  isGroup?: boolean,      // Whether this outbound message belongs to a group/channel context
  groupId?: string,       // Group/channel identifier for correlation with message:received
}

// message:transcribed context
{
  from?: string,          // Sender identifier
  to?: string,            // Recipient identifier
  body?: string,          // Raw inbound body before enrichment
  bodyForAgent?: string,  // Enriched body visible to the agent
  transcript: string,     // Audio transcript text
  timestamp?: number,     // Unix timestamp when received
  channelId: string,      // Channel (e.g., "telegram", "whatsapp")
  conversationId?: string,
  messageId?: string,
  senderId?: string,      // Sender user ID
  senderName?: string,    // Sender display name
  senderUsername?: string,
  provider?: string,      // Provider name
  surface?: string,       // Surface name
  mediaPath?: string,     // Path to the media file that was transcribed
  mediaType?: string,     // MIME type of the media
}

// message:preprocessed context
{
  from?: string,          // Sender identifier
  to?: string,            // Recipient identifier
  body?: string,          // Raw inbound body
  bodyForAgent?: string,  // Final enriched body after media/link understanding
  transcript?: string,    // Transcript when audio was present
  timestamp?: number,     // Unix timestamp when received
  channelId: string,      // Channel (e.g., "telegram", "whatsapp")
  conversationId?: string,
  messageId?: string,
  senderId?: string,      // Sender user ID
  senderName?: string,    // Sender display name
  senderUsername?: string,
  provider?: string,      // Provider name
  surface?: string,       // Surface name
  mediaPath?: string,     // Path to the media file
  mediaType?: string,     // MIME type of the media
  isGroup?: boolean,
  groupId?: string,
}
```

#### Example: Message Logger Hook

```typescript
const isMessageReceivedEvent = (event: { type: string; action: string }) =>
  event.type === "message" && event.action === "received";
const isMessageSentEvent = (event: { type: string; action: string }) =>
  event.type === "message" && event.action === "sent";

const handler = async (event) => {
  if (isMessageReceivedEvent(event as { type: string; action: string })) {
    console.log(`[message-logger] Received from ${event.context.from}: ${event.context.content}`);
  } else if (isMessageSentEvent(event as { type: string; action: string })) {
    console.log(`[message-logger] Sent to ${event.context.to}: ${event.context.content}`);
  }
};

export default handler;
```

### Tool Result Hooks (Plugin API)

These hooks are not event-stream listeners; they let plugins synchronously adjust tool results before OpenClaw persists them.

- **`tool_result_persist`**: transform tool results before they are written to the session transcript. Must be synchronous; return the updated tool result payload or `undefined` to keep it as-is. See [Agent Loop](/concepts/agent-loop).

### Plugin Hook Events

#### before_tool_call

Runs before each tool call. Plugins can modify parameters, block the call, or request user approval.

Return fields:

- **`params`**: Override tool parameters (merged with original params)
- **`block`**: Set to `true` to block the tool call
- **`blockReason`**: Reason shown to the agent when blocked
- **`requireApproval`**: Pause execution and wait for user approval via channels

The `requireApproval` field triggers native platform approval (Telegram buttons, Discord components, `/approve` command) instead of relying on the agent to cooperate:

```typescript
{
  requireApproval: {
    title: "Sensitive operation",
    description: "This tool call modifies production data",
    severity: "warning",       // "info" | "warning" | "critical"
    timeoutMs: 120000,         // default: 120s
    timeoutBehavior: "deny",   // "allow" | "deny" (default)
    onResolution: async (decision) => {
      // Called after the user resolves: "allow-once", "allow-always", "deny", "timeout", or "cancelled"
    },
  }
}
```

The `onResolution` callback is invoked with the final decision string after the approval resolves, times out, or is cancelled. It runs in-process within the plugin (not sent to the gateway). Use it to persist decisions, update caches, or perform cleanup.

The `pluginId` field is stamped automatically by the hook runner from the plugin registration. When multiple plugins return `requireApproval`, the first one (highest priority) wins.

`block` takes precedence over `requireApproval`: if the merged hook result has both `block: true` and a `requireApproval` field, the tool call is blocked immediately without triggering the approval flow. This ensures a higher-priority plugin's block cannot be overridden by a lower-priority plugin's approval request.

If the gateway is unavailable or does not support plugin approvals, the tool call falls back to a soft block using the `description` as the block reason.

#### before_install

Runs after the built-in install security scan and before installation continues. OpenClaw fires this hook for interactive skill installs as well as plugin bundle, package, and single-file installs.

Default behavior differs by target type:

- Plugin installs fail closed on built-in scan `critical` findings and scan errors unless the operator explicitly uses `openclaw plugins install --dangerously-force-unsafe-install`.
- Skill installs still surface built-in scan findings and scan errors as warnings and continue by default.

Return fields:

- **`findings`**: Additional scan findings to surface as warnings
- **`block`**: Set to `true` to block the install
- **`blockReason`**: Human-readable reason shown when blocked

Event fields:

- **`targetType`**: Install target category (`skill` or `plugin`)
- **`targetName`**: Human-readable skill name or plugin id for the install target
- **`sourcePath`**: Absolute path to the install target content being scanned
- **`sourcePathKind`**: Whether the scanned content is a `file` or `directory`
- **`origin`**: Normalized install origin when available (for example `openclaw-bundled`, `openclaw-workspace`, `plugin-bundle`, `plugin-package`, or `plugin-file`)
- **`request`**: Provenance for the install request, including `kind`, `mode`, and optional `requestedSpecifier`
- **`builtinScan`**: Structured result of the built-in scanner, including `status`, summary counts, findings, and optional `error`
- **`skill`**: Skill install metadata when `targetType` is `skill`, including `installId` and the selected `installSpec`
- **`plugin`**: Plugin install metadata when `targetType` is `plugin`, including the canonical `pluginId`, normalized `contentType`, optional `packageName` / `manifestId` / `version`, and `extensions`

Example event (plugin package install):

```json
{
  "targetType": "plugin",
  "targetName": "acme-audit",
  "sourcePath": "/var/folders/.../openclaw-plugin-acme-audit/package",
  "sourcePathKind": "directory",
  "origin": "plugin-package",
  "request": {
    "kind": "plugin-npm",
    "mode": "install",
    "requestedSpecifier": "@acme/openclaw-plugin-audit@1.4.2"
  },
  "builtinScan": {
    "status": "ok",
    "scannedFiles": 12,
    "critical": 0,
    "warn": 1,
    "info": 0,
    "findings": [
      {
        "severity": "warn",
        "ruleId": "network_fetch",
        "file": "dist/index.js",
        "line": 88,
        "message": "Dynamic network fetch detected during install review."
      }
    ]
  },
  "plugin": {
    "pluginId": "acme-audit",
    "contentType": "package",
    "packageName": "@acme/openclaw-plugin-audit",
    "manifestId": "acme-audit",
    "version": "1.4.2",
    "extensions": ["./dist/index.js"]
  }
}
```

Skill installs use the same event shape with `targetType: "skill"` and a `skill` object instead of `plugin`.

Decision semantics:

- `before_install`: `{ block: true }` is terminal and stops lower-priority handlers.
- `before_install`: `{ block: false }` is treated as no decision.

Use this hook for external security scanners, policy engines, or enterprise approval gates that need to audit install sources before they are installed.

#### Compaction lifecycle

Compaction lifecycle hooks exposed through the plugin hook runner:

- **`before_compaction`**: Runs before compaction with count/token metadata
- **`after_compaction`**: Runs after compaction with compaction summary metadata

### Complete Plugin Hook Reference

All 28 hooks registered via the Plugin SDK. Hooks marked **sequential** run in priority order and can modify results; **parallel** hooks are fire-and-forget.

#### Model and prompt hooks

| Hook                   | When                                         | Execution  | Returns                                                    |

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `before_tool_call`    | Before each tool call                         | Sequential           | `{ params?, block?, blockReason?, requireApproval? }` |
| `after_tool_call`     | After a tool call completes                   | Parallel             | `void`                                                |

#### Subagent hooks

| Hook                       | When                                       | Execution  | Returns                           |

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `before_install` | After built-in security scan, before install proceeds | Sequential | `{ findings?, block?, blockReason? }` |

<Note>
Two hooks (`tool_result_persist` and `before_message_write`) are **synchronous only** — they must not return a Promise. Returning a Promise from these hooks is caught at runtime and the result is discarded with a warning.
</Note>

For full handler signatures and context types, see [Plugin Architecture](/plugins/architecture).

### Future Events

The following event types are planned for the internal hook event stream.
Note that `session_start` and `session_end` already exist as [Plugin Hook API](/plugins/architecture#provider-runtime-hooks) hooks
but are not yet available as internal hook event keys in `HOOK.md` metadata:

- **`session:start`**: When a new session begins (planned for internal hook stream; available as plugin hook `session_start`)
- **`session:end`**: When a session ends (planned for internal hook stream; available as plugin hook `session_end`)
- **`agent:error`**: When an agent encounters an error

## Creating Custom Hooks

### 1. Choose Location

- **Workspace hooks** (`<workspace>/hooks/`): Per-agent; can add new hook names but cannot override bundled, managed, or plugin hooks with the same name
- **Managed hooks** (`~/.openclaw/hooks/`): Shared across workspaces; can override bundled and plugin hooks

### 2. Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/hooks/my-hook
cd ~/.openclaw/hooks/my-hook
```

### 3. Create HOOK.md

```markdown
---
name: my-hook
description: "Does something useful"
metadata: { "openclaw": { "emoji": "🎯", "events": ["command:new"] } }
---

# My Custom Hook

This hook does something useful when you issue `/new`.
```

### 4. Create handler.ts

```typescript
const handler = async (event) => {
  if (event.type !== "command" || event.action !== "new") {
    return;
  }

  console.log("[my-hook] Running!");
  // Your logic here
};

export default handler;
```

### 5. Enable and Test

```bash
# Verify hook is discovered
openclaw hooks list

# Enable it
openclaw hooks enable my-hook

# Restart your gateway process (menu bar app restart on macOS, or restart your dev process)

# Trigger the event
# Send /new via your messaging channel
```

## Configuration

### New Config Format (Recommended)

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": {
        "session-memory": { "enabled": true },
        "command-logger": { "enabled": false }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Per-Hook Configuration

Hooks can have custom configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": {
        "my-hook": {
          "enabled": true,
          "env": {
            "MY_CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Extra Directories

Load hooks from additional directories (treated as managed hooks, same override precedence):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "load": {
        "extraDirs": ["/path/to/more/hooks"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Legacy Config Format (Still Supported)

The old config format still works for backwards compatibility:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "handlers": [
        {
          "event": "command:new",
          "module": "./hooks/handlers/my-handler.ts",
          "export": "default"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note: `module` must be a workspace-relative path. Absolute paths and traversal outside the workspace are rejected.

**Migration**: Use the new discovery-based system for new hooks. Legacy handlers are loaded after directory-based hooks.

## CLI Commands

### List Hooks

```bash
# List all hooks
openclaw hooks list

# Show only eligible hooks
openclaw hooks list --eligible

# Verbose output (show missing requirements)
openclaw hooks list --verbose

# JSON output
openclaw hooks list --json
```

### Hook Information

```bash
# Show detailed info about a hook
openclaw hooks info session-memory

# JSON output
openclaw hooks info session-memory --json
```

### Check Eligibility

```bash
# Show eligibility summary
openclaw hooks check

# JSON output
openclaw hooks check --json
```

### Enable/Disable

```bash
# Enable a hook
openclaw hooks enable session-memory

# Disable a hook
openclaw hooks disable command-logger
```

## Bundled hook reference

### session-memory

Saves session context to memory when you issue `/new` or `/reset`.

**Events**: `command:new`, `command:reset`

**Requirements**: `workspace.dir` must be configured

**Output**: `<workspace>/memory/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` (defaults to `~/.openclaw/workspace`)

**What it does**:

1. Uses the pre-reset session entry to locate the correct transcript
2. Extracts the last 15 user/assistant messages from the conversation (configurable)
3. Uses LLM to generate a descriptive filename slug
4. Saves session metadata to a dated memory file

**Example output**:

```markdown
# Session: 2026-01-16 14:30:00 UTC

- **Session Key**: agent:main:main
- **Session ID**: abc123def456
- **Source**: telegram

## Conversation Summary

user: Can you help me design the API?
assistant: Sure! Let's start with the endpoints...
```

**Filename examples**:

- `2026-01-16-vendor-pitch.md`
- `2026-01-16-api-design.md`
- `2026-01-16-1430.md` (fallback timestamp if slug generation fails)

**Enable**:

```bash
openclaw hooks enable session-memory
```

### bootstrap-extra-files

Injects additional bootstrap files (for example monorepo-local `AGENTS.md` / `TOOLS.md`) during `agent:bootstrap`.

**Events**: `agent:bootstrap`

**Requirements**: `workspace.dir` must be configured

**Output**: No files written; bootstrap context is modified in-memory only.

**Config**:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": {
        "bootstrap-extra-files": {
          "enabled": true,
          "paths": ["packages/*/AGENTS.md", "packages/*/TOOLS.md"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Config options**:

- `paths` (string[]): glob/path patterns to resolve from the workspace.
- `patterns` (string[]): alias of `paths`.
- `files` (string[]): alias of `paths`.

**Notes**:

- Paths are resolved relative to workspace.
- Files must stay inside workspace (realpath-checked).
- Only recognized bootstrap basenames are loaded (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory.md`).
- For subagent/cron sessions a narrower allowlist applies (`AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`).

**Enable**:

```bash
openclaw hooks enable bootstrap-extra-files
```

### command-logger

Logs all command events to a centralized audit file.

**Events**: `command`

**Requirements**: None

**Output**: `~/.openclaw/logs/commands.log`

**What it does**:

1. Captures event details (command action, timestamp, session key, sender ID, source)
2. Appends to log file in JSONL format
3. Runs silently in the background

**Example log entries**:

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2026-01-16T14:30:00.000Z","action":"new","sessionKey":"agent:main:main","senderId":"+1234567890","source":"telegram"}
{"timestamp":"2026-01-16T15:45:22.000Z","action":"stop","sessionKey":"agent:main:main","senderId":"user@example.com","source":"whatsapp"}
```

**View logs**:

```bash
# View recent commands
tail -n 20 ~/.openclaw/logs/commands.log

# Pretty-print with jq
cat ~/.openclaw/logs/commands.log | jq .

# Filter by action
grep '"action":"new"' ~/.openclaw/logs/commands.log | jq .
```

**Enable**:

```bash
openclaw hooks enable command-logger
```

### boot-md

Runs `BOOT.md` when the gateway starts (after channels start).
Internal hooks must be enabled for this to run.

**Events**: `gateway:startup`

**Requirements**: `workspace.dir` must be configured

**What it does**:

1. Reads `BOOT.md` from your workspace
2. Runs the instructions via the agent runner
3. Sends any requested outbound messages via the message tool

**Enable**:

```bash
openclaw hooks enable boot-md
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Handlers Fast

Hooks run during command processing. Keep them lightweight:

```typescript
// ✓ Good - async work, returns immediately
const handler: HookHandler = async (event) => {
  void processInBackground(event); // Fire and forget
};

// ✗ Bad - blocks command processing
const handler: HookHandler = async (event) => {
  await slowDatabaseQuery(event);
  await evenSlowerAPICall(event);
};
```

### Handle Errors Gracefully

Always wrap risky operations:

```typescript
const handler: HookHandler = async (event) => {
  try {
    await riskyOperation(event);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("[my-handler] Failed:", err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err));
    // Don't throw - let other handlers run
  }
};
```

### Filter Events Early

Return early if the event isn't relevant:

```typescript
const handler: HookHandler = async (event) => {
  // Only handle 'new' commands
  if (event.type !== "command" || event.action !== "new") {
    return;
  }

  // Your logic here
};
```

### Use Specific Event Keys

Specify exact events in metadata when possible:

```yaml
metadata: { "openclaw": { "events": ["command:new"] } } # Specific
```

Rather than:

```yaml
metadata: { "openclaw": { "events": ["command"] } } # General - more overhead
```

## Debugging

### Enable Hook Logging

The gateway logs hook loading at startup:

```text
Registered hook: session-memory -> command:new, command:reset
Registered hook: bootstrap-extra-files -> agent:bootstrap
Registered hook: command-logger -> command
Registered hook: boot-md -> gateway:startup
```

### Check Discovery

List all discovered hooks:

```bash
openclaw hooks list --verbose
```

### Check Registration

In your handler, log when it's called:

```typescript
const handler: HookHandler = async (event) => {
  console.log("[my-handler] Triggered:", event.type, event.action);
  // Your logic
};
```

### Verify Eligibility

Check why a hook isn't eligible:

```bash
openclaw hooks info my-hook
```

Look for missing requirements in the output.

## Testing

### Gateway Logs

Monitor gateway logs to see hook execution:

```bash
# macOS
./scripts/clawlog.sh -f

# Other platforms
tail -f ~/.openclaw/gateway.log
```

### Test Hooks Directly

Test your handlers in isolation:

```typescript
import { test } from "vitest";
import myHandler from "./hooks/my-hook/handler.js";

test("my handler works", async () => {
  const event = {
    type: "command",
    action: "new",
    sessionKey: "test-session",
    timestamp: new Date(),
    messages: [],
    context: { foo: "bar" },
  };

  await myHandler(event);

  // Assert side effects
});
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`src/hooks/types.ts`**: Type definitions
- **`src/hooks/workspace.ts`**: Directory scanning and loading
- **`src/hooks/frontmatter.ts`**: HOOK.md metadata parsing
- **`src/hooks/config.ts`**: Eligibility checking
- **`src/hooks/hooks-status.ts`**: Status reporting
- **`src/hooks/loader.ts`**: Dynamic module loader
- **`src/cli/hooks-cli.ts`**: CLI commands
- **`src/gateway/server-startup.ts`**: Loads hooks at gateway start
- **`src/auto-reply/reply/commands-core.ts`**: Triggers command events

### Discovery Flow

```
Gateway startup
    ↓
Scan directories (bundled → plugin → managed + extra dirs → workspace)
    ↓
Parse HOOK.md files
    ↓
Sort by override precedence (bundled < plugin < managed < workspace)
    ↓
Check eligibility (bins, env, config, os)
    ↓
Load handlers from eligible hooks
    ↓
Register handlers for events
```

### Event Flow

```
User sends /new
    ↓
Command validation
    ↓
Create hook event
    ↓
Trigger hook (all registered handlers)
    ↓
Command processing continues
    ↓
Session reset
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Discovered

1. Check directory structure:

   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.openclaw/hooks/my-hook/
   # Should show: HOOK.md, handler.ts
   ```

2. Verify HOOK.md format:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.openclaw/hooks/my-hook/HOOK.md
   # Should have YAML frontmatter with name and metadata
   ```

3. List all discovered hooks:

   ```bash
   openclaw hooks list
   ```

### Hook Not Eligible

Check requirements:

```bash
openclaw hooks info my-hook
```

Look for missing:

- Binaries (check PATH)
- Environment variables
- Config values
- OS compatibility

### Hook Not Executing

1. Verify hook is enabled:

   ```bash
   openclaw hooks list
   # Should show ✓ next to enabled hooks
   ```

2. Restart your gateway process so hooks reload.

3. Check gateway logs for errors:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/clawlog.sh | grep hook
   ```

### Handler Errors

Check for TypeScript/import errors:

```bash
# Test import directly
node -e "import('./path/to/handler.ts').then(console.log)"
```

## Migration Guide

### From Legacy Config to Discovery

**Before**:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "handlers": [
        {
          "event": "command:new",
          "module": "./hooks/handlers/my-handler.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**After**:

1. Create hook directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/hooks/my-hook
   mv ./hooks/handlers/my-handler.ts ~/.openclaw/hooks/my-hook/handler.ts
   ```

2. Create HOOK.md:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-hook
   description: "My custom hook"
   metadata: { "openclaw": { "emoji": "🎯", "events": ["command:new"] } }
   ---

   # My Hook

   Does something useful.
   ```

3. Update config:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "internal": {
         "enabled": true,
         "entries": {
           "my-hook": { "enabled": true }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Verify and restart your gateway process:

   ```bash
   openclaw hooks list
   # Should show: 🎯 my-hook ✓
   ```

**Benefits of migration**:

- Automatic discovery
- CLI management
- Eligibility checking
- Better documentation
- Consistent structure
